TODO:
- Fix Blinking of render after attribute is modified. The old screen is first rendered, then updated with updated elements...
- Duplicates popup: allow to remove possible matches
- Hints for table pagination, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17067294/html-table-with-100-width-with-vertical-scroll-inside-tbody ?? or https://react-table.js.org/#/story/simple-table (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table) or https://datatables.net/examples/styling/semanticui https://datatables.net/download/npm
- do not consider files times (modified, created...) different if the difference is a matter of seconds ??
- Remove import CONST_SCAN_TYPE_DUPLICATE from ResultTabReferencesView... The object scanType should not be checked... Add a method to the FileProps class ?
- Move FileProps class to Scanner ? They are deeply linked... But not that much, they are mostly the return of doScan, which is used everywhere... Create a FilePropsScan class that inherits from FileProps ??
- Remove resultState reducer, should be states in ResultContainer...
- Move scan state of ScanContainer into Scanner.scan function ? We would need to way to make cancelable...
- Add method to save Db before coming back + indicator in interface that it needs to be saved...
- Take .index.idb~ file only for writing (or when start modifying ?). Save as soon as possible, to reload or brutal shutdown of the window will not be an issue... Also, when taking the file, try to force taking it if it already exists. Check that 2 concurrent windows cannot (on windows at least...)...
- Allow to compress database file
- Add onIgnore management, and display list of ignored files/folders...


- NewFiles tab: Copy to database (and choose folder => rescan on all files not linked to a dbFile's hash (duplicates and new files)). Checkbox to multiple select to move several files in a row to a folder in db (choose folder + allow to create new folders).
- actions in modal (rename, modify attributes, copy??or delete from db)
- change db and folder labels to the names of the folders
- move to TableContainer for the management of all lists: DuplicateTab, MissingTab, IndexationAnomaliesView, ResultTabDuplicateView, ResultTabIdenticalView, ResultTabNewView
- change printValue to a ValueRenderer

- fix the copyModifiedAttributeTo: when file is modified, re-index (to be sure), then relaunch scan for this dbFile and the scan file...
- for copy of files in the db, we may need to relaunch a full rescan...
- Files are duplicated between the 5th tab and the tab where each file is. Do not display them anymore in the tab ?
- Bug on full re-indexation: the removed files are not removed... We should remove the entire database (rename the file to .bak ?)...
- fix the analyse: it is not async, so the progress is never displayed...
- Add cancel/stop to indexing, scanning, analysing...
- Fix fileProps seams to be saved in db (matches field in db...)???
- fix on re-indexation: the content is not scrollable, so we do not have the all list of elements updated...
